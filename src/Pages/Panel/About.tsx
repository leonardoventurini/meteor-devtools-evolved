            The extension initializes with the page content, which means you
            have to refresh the page after installation, also it needs the
            devtools panel to be opened at least once in the current tab for any
            messages to be processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than that you can just explore the extension at your leisure.
            It should be easy enough.
